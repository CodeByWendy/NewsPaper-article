                    <img src="images/GirlCode.jpg" alt="Women in Tech">
                    <These>From coding bootcamps to leadership roles, women are breaking barriers in South Africa’s growing
                        tech industry. Initiatives like GirlCode and SheCodes are leading the change. These initiatives are crucial in adressing the gender imbalance in the tech industry. By providing training, mentorship and supporting women with the skills needed to succed in a rapidly growning field</p>
                    <p>“When women are included in technology, innovation becomes more creative, solutions are more inclusive, and communities
                    thrive,” says GirlCode founder Zandile Mkwanazi.</p>
                
                    <p>The impact of these efforts is already visible. According to recent studies, the number of women enrolling in coding
                    bootcamps and computer science programs in South Africa has increased significantly in the past five years. More local
                    startups are being founded or co-founded by women, and major tech companies are recognising the value of diverse teams
                    that better reflect the communities they serve.</p>
